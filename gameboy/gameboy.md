I can't host any copyrighted games on my website, but if you have your own ROMs you can play them in the emulators here.

[Play in your browser with your own Gameboy games](asmjs)

Chrome Native Client (NaCl) demos: [2D graphics API](nacl2), [3D graphics API](nacl3)
The version using the 3D graphics API features better scaling support, but may not run on all computers.
